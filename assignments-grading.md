### Late Work Policy

This course works best when everybody completes their work by the designated deadlines. This prevents cascading tardiness from overwhelming both students and teaching staff. However, sometimes there are situations that call for extensions. Some examples from the last few years include the following:
* The death of friend or family member
* A wedding in the family
* A serious accident
* A surgery
* A significant illness
* A mental health crisis or episode
* An important religious or national holiday

We care about you and your well being more than we care about deadlines and if something difficult is happening in your life which is making it hard for you to complete an assignment on time please contact us so we can talk. We have found that, often, the students who most need some leeway are those least likely to ask for it. It never hurts to ask. We will work out a plan so you can complete the requirements of the course with your physical and psychological health intact. Do not feel ashamed to reach out to us. We are eager to see you succeed.

### Academic Integrity

Any cheating or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the University policies on academic integrity. In general, high-level discussion of tools, concepts, and formalisms is acceptable collaboration and is encouraged. Sharing specific aspects of solutions or results with other students, or consulting work from previous semesters or other universities, is considered cheating. Please feel free to use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub copilot, but you are responsible for any content you submit.
