## Final Poster & Presentation

The final project for this course is a **public, Demo Day-style poster session** where students present their final startup concept in lieu of a final exam. This accounts for **30% of your grade**.

### Expectations

The Final Demo Day Poster Session will take place on **April 24, 2026** in the AM of AIVS.co's demo day during OPEN COFFEE: AI EDITION.

**During the session, you will:**
* Deliver a series of 60-90 second pitches
* Engage with visitors and gather feedback
* Network with founders, funders, mentors, and collaborators

### What to Include

Your final poster and presentation should showcase your AI-empowered venture and include:

* **Validated problem statement** - A clear articulation of the problem you're solving
* **Unique solution** - Your approach to solving this problem with AI
* **Initial financial plan** - Milestone-based budget and financial projections
* **Go-to-market strategy** - How you plan to acquire and retain customers
* **Compelling pitch** - A narrative that demonstrates founder-market fit and venture potential

### Post-Demo Day Reflection

After Demo Day, you will submit a short reflection on interest shown for potential teammates, investors, customers, or other engaged parties.
