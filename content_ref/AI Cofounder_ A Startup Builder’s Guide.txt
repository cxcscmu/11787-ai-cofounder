AI Cofounder: A Startup Builder’s Guide
1. Description and Objective
AI Cofounder: A Startup Builder’s Guide is a 13-week, project-based course for technically inclined individuals who are interested in launching startups, particularly those centered on or enabled by AI. This course is specifically designed for students who envision themselves as the AI cofounder, the person responsible for leading the AI or technical direction of a venture. The targeted startup is an AI-oriented or AI-related venture, and students will be expected to leverage AI to design solutions, drive innovation, and accelerate the development and growth of a future venture.


The course previews a practical framework for ideating, building, leading, and scaling a technology startup, following the real-world journey from initial idea through market validation and fundraising preparation. It is especially relevant for technical leaders who want to extend their business savvy, and who aim to create venture-scale value with AI. As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, the course will adapt in real-time to market conditions and technology news, ensuring students are working with the most current tools or technology, mental models, and data.


The primary objective is for every student to develop their own founder’s playbook. Through applied-skills workshops, founder stories, and domain-specific case studies (e.g., fintech, health-tech, climate), students will learn to translate technical expertise into entrepreneurial action. By the end of the course, each student will have drafted and explored a viable startup concept including a validated problem statement, an initial financial plan, a go-to-market strategy, and a compelling pitch culminating in a public poster session that showcases their AI-empowered venture in the AM of AIVS.co’s demo day during OPEN COFFEE: AI EDITION.


Learning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Identify and validate compelling problems as a basis for a startup, establish founder-problem fit, and pinpoint unique opportunities through effective market analysis that could lead to venture-scale value.
* Structure a founding team, define a culture, and map a co-founder equity philosophy.
* Create a milestone-based budget, understand startup financial fundamentals, and analyze strategic funding sources and investor fit.
* Navigate core legal considerations for early startups, including incorporation and IP.
* Apply “design thinking” principles to generate customer insights and inform product direction.
* Develop and execute go-to-market (GTM) strategies focused on early customer acquisition.
* Develop a compelling narrative and pitch for their venture.
* Inventory where AI can play the role of a founding team member, lead a function e.g., marketing, or assist or augment the human cofounder building a startup

3. Target Audience & Prerequisites
Target Audience: This course is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in entrepreneurship, particularly those with a background or strong interest in AI. It is well suited for individuals exploring the idea of starting an AI-oriented company, developing a specific AI-related concept, or already in the early stages of building a venture where AI plays a central role.


Target Class Size: This is a popular topic while also filling a missing piece of our current educational offering. Thus we expect it to be a popular class targeting the size of 100 students.


Prerequisites: There are no formal course prerequisites. Background/expertise in computer science, specifically AI is required as this class is targeting AI company founders. A strong interest in technology, innovation, and problem-solving is expected. This class will pair with AI Venture Studio (AIVS.co), but it is not required to take the course.
4. Course Format
The course meets twice per week over 13 weeks, followed by a final presentation and poster session. The format is highly interactive and designed to balance theory with practice. Classes will be held every Friday from 11am-1:50pm, and each class consists of two parts:
* Part 1: Applied Foundations (11am-12:15pm, 1h 15mins): Focuses on a core startup skill or concept through hands-on lecture and workshop, where students apply frameworks towards their own venture ideas.
* Part 2: Founders in the Field (12:30am-1:50pm, 1h 20mins): Features guest speakers (e.g., serial founders, venture capitalists, industry experts), to provide direct exposure to real-world challenges and successes in the startup world, followed by group discussion and Q&A.

	Late Work Policy
This course works best when everybody completes their work by the designated deadlines. This prevents cascading tardiness from overwhelming both students and teaching staff. However, sometimes there are situations that call for extensions. Some examples from the last few years include the following:
* The death of friend or family member
* A wedding in the family
* A serious accident
* A surgery
* A significant illness
* A mental health crisis or episode
* An important religious or national holiday
We care about you and your well being more than we care about deadlines and if something difficult is happening in your life which is making it hard for you to complete an assignment on time please contact us so we can talk. We have found that, often, the students who most need some leeway are those least likely to ask for it. It never hurts to ask. We will work out a plan so you can complete the requirements of the course with your physical and psychological health intact. Do not feel ashamed to reach out to us. We are eager to see you succeed.
Academic Integrity
Any cheating or plagiarism will be dealt with according to the University policies on academic integrity. In general, high-level discussion of tools, concepts, and formalisms is acceptable collaboration and is encouraged. Sharing specific aspects of solutions or results with other students, or consulting work from previous semesters or other universities, is considered cheating. Please feel free to use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub copilot, but you are responsible for any content you submit.

	7. Relationship to Other Courses
This course is designed to be a distinct and complementary part of the university's entrepreneurship ecosystem. We view this class as the first introductory class that exposes students interested in exploring the startup path to the basic concepts of entrepreneurship. 


1. 11681 AI Venture Studio 


This course is designed as a pairing of AI Venture Studio although not required, offering students a structured opportunity to explore their AI-centered ventures outside of the studio environment without requiring a formal build process. While AI Venture Studio provides an incubator setting focused on early experimentation and company formation, this course enriches that foundation with a deeper emphasis on venture strategy, validation, and go-to-market planning that is hard to incorporate when prioritizing active building time. It is ideal for students who have participated in the Studio and want to further evolve their ideas toward a launch-ready startup. More information about AI Venture Studio (AI//VS) can be found at AIVS.co.


2. 94807 Entrepreneurship: A New Venture


This course is positioned as a practical, action-oriented counterpart to the foundational "94807 Entrepreneurship: A New Venture." While "94807" provides a broad conceptual framework for entrepreneurship through team-based business plan development, "AI Cofounder" centers on the iterative, hands-on application of these principles. It is distinguished by its unique "AI Cofounder" theme, a weekly "build-and-reflect" sprint cycle focused on individual artifacts, and a final Demo Day-style poster presentation (with founders and funders in attendance) instead of a formal business plan. The two courses are complementary, with students ideally taking "94807" to gain a theoretical understanding and applying those concepts in "AI Cofounder" to build a specific venture.


3. 45996 Corporate Startup Lab


45996 Corporate Startup Lab (CSL) centers on fostering new ventures within large corporate structures, applying venture best practices to their unique challenges and advantages, "AI Cofounder" provides a framework for individual founders to build a startup from scratch, emphasizing rapid iteration and the strategic integration of AI. Both courses aim to cultivate entrepreneurial mindsets and capabilities, but "AI Cofounder" offers a distinct hands-on, founder-centric approach outside the corporate setting, preparing students for independent venture creation.
