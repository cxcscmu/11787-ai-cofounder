**5-min video** on why you are raising capital and specific investor fit. Develop a target list of 10-20 investors because of their thesis/stage overlap (including accelerators or angels).

This weekly reflection combines a short written artifact and a 5-minute video presentation, applying the week's topic to your startup project.
